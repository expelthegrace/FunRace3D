Demo created by Marc Palomar Soler

Task: mirror the Fun Race 3D mobile game
Time max: 5 hours
Time used: 5 hours

The parts that were difficult for you and why:
- decide which obstacles to create and yet be a fun game
- create a death cam appealing within the time given


The parts you think you could do better and how:
- cleaner code of course. I tried to note every part but it could be much better
- improve the map design to make it more fun to play in
- camera could improve with some tweaks on the rotation

What you would do if you could go a step further on this game:
- particles effects 100%
- UI

What did you think:
- a bit nervous but I enjoyed a lot creating the fun aspects of the game


Any comment you may have:
- I was really nervous at the start and I missed the the first hour commit on github.
- I tried to focus on the tasks that I considered a must to have. I might be wrong but I enjoyed a lot doing it
- Thanks for your time
